#Homer goes to a cool website to compare Simpsons episodes. When he arrives on the home page, he notices the title
#Rate Simpsons Episodes (any better title ideas?)

#He is immediately prompted with two episodes to rate. Each episode has an image, a title and description.

#He prefers the episode on the left. Upon clicking it, the page refreshes with two new episodes to compare.

#Each episode again has an image, a title, and a description. This time he prefers the episode on the right. Once again,
#the page refreshes and two new episodes are presented.

#This time he chooses "tie" and two new episodes are presented.

#This time he chooses "skip" and two new episodes are presented.

#He eventually clicks "top episodes" to see the best episodes. They are rated in descending order.

#Satisfied, he leaves the site to pay a visit to Lard Lad Donuts.
